## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pywebview
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhiraj-ydv/stopwatch-app.git
cd stopwatch-app
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pywebview
```

### 3️⃣ Run the app
```bash
python main.py
```

A native window will open — no browser required.

---

## 🖥️ How to Use

1.  **Start/Stop:** Click the main button to start the stopwatch. Click it again to stop.
2.  **Create New Database:** Use the "Create DB" button in the top toolbar to select a location and name for a new session database (`.json` file).
3.  **Open Existing Database:** Use the "Open DB" button in the top toolbar to load an existing session database.
4.  **View Session History:** Click the "Sessions History" button in the footer to open a new window displaying all recorded sessions.
5.  **Current DB Path:** The path to the currently active session database is displayed in the footer.

---

## 💾 Data Storage

Stopwatch sessions are saved automatically to the selected or created `.json` file. The path to this file is remembered in `config.json`.

---

## 🎨 User Interface

### 🪟 Fluent Design Feel
- Clean, modern layout with a responsive design.
- White rounded container with subtle shadows.
- Windows 11 accent blue (`#0078d7`) for primary elements.
- Smooth animations on hover and buttons.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

**PyWebView** acts as a native app shell, displaying the web UI and connecting JavaScript to Python methods via the `window.pywebview.api` bridge. The Python backend handles all core logic, data persistence, and native OS interactions (like file dialogs and creating new windows).

---

## 🏗️ Packaging into an Executable (Optional)

To create a `.exe` for Windows:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```

The app will be packaged into `/dist/Stopwatch.exe` and can run on any Windows machine without a Python installation.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

🚧 Planned features:  
- 🌓 Light/Dark mode toggle
- ☁️ Optional cloud sync
